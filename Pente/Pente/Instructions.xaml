Or, win by capturing five (or more) pairs of your opponent's stones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How to Play:&#xD;&#xA;Play starts with the board completely clear of stones. The first player (black) begins the game by playing one stone on the center point. Thereafter the players take turns placing their stones, one at a time, on any empty intersection(Not the squares). Once played, a stone cannot be moved again, except when removed by a capture. Players alternate turns adding new stones to the board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Captures:&#xD;&#xA;Whenever your opponent has two stones (and only two) which are adjacent, those stones are vulnerable to capture. The pair can be captured by bracketing its two ends with your own stones. The captured stones are removed from the board. Captures can be made vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and multiple captures can occur on a single move.&#xD;&#xA;"
